# Console Utilities

This is a .bashrc file that you can use to customize your login when you are using the concole. It is based off of the RetroPie version.

Just replace your current .bachrc with this one.

Save your old version.
```
mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.bak
```
Copy the new version.
```
cp BMO-Utils/pi/bashrc ~/.bashrc
```
BMO should now greet you with some useful information when you log in.
